# bsky-viewer

fxtwitter/vxtwitter-like proxy for generating Bluesky embeds on Discord.

Currently hosted at https://bsky-viewer.branchpanic.workers.dev. To use, replace "https://bsky.app" in the beginning of a Bluesky post URL:

```diff
- https://bsky.app/profile/branchpanic.me/post/3k4knknoxkd2g
+ https://bsky-viewer.branchpanic.workers.dev/profile/branchpanic.me/post/3k4knknoxkd2g
```

I would buy a short URL for it, but this will presumably get native support at some point.
